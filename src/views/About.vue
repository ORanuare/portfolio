        <h5>Hey there,</h5>

        <p>I'm Oscar Ranuare, a passionate full stack web developer with a talent for turning ideas into digital reality. <b>With over five years of self-taught programming experience</b> under my belt, I've dived into the intricate world of web development, honing my skills across various technologies and frameworks.</p>

        <p>From crafting seamless backend solutions with Python and Django to architecting lightning-fast APIs using FastAPI, I thrive on the challenge of <b>building robust, scalable systems</b> that deliver exceptional user experiences. On the frontend, I wield the power of JavaScript and TypeScript into web applications, leveraging frameworks like Vue.js to create <b>dynamic interfaces that captivate and engage users</b>.</p>

        <p>But it's not just about the code for me – I'm <b>equally passionate about the aesthetics and user interface design</b>, embracing modern design principles with tools like Tailwind CSS to create sleek, responsive layouts.</p>

        <p>When it comes to version control and collaboration, I'm no stranger to Git and GitHub, seamlessly <b>integrating into development workflows to streamline processes and facilitate teamwork</b>. And let's not forget about databases – I'm well-versed in PostgreSQL and some MongoDB, ensuring data is managed efficiently and securely across projects.</p>

        <p>Whether it's deploying applications on Heroku, harnessing the power of cloud services like Google Cloud and AWS, or navigating the world of Linux, I'm <b>always eager to explore new technologies and push the boundaries</b> of what's possible in web development.</p>

        <p>Let's collaborate and bring your vision to life – drop me a line, and let's make magic happen!</p>
